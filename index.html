              <p class="text-left mb-5">
                BMI stands for body mass index. It is used to determine whether or not someone has an unhealthy weight.
              </p>

              <p class="text-left">
                Having a <i>healthy body mass index</i>   is one of the most important things you can do to live a happy, healthier life. 
                <br>If your BMI is higher than average, you should be conscious about any changes you make to improve your health.
              </p>
              <p class="text-left">
                For example, people with a <i>normal weight may want</i>  to consider changing their diet or exercise regime if they notice their BMI rising.
              </p>
              <p class="text-left">
                On the other hand, individuals who are very overweight might want to think about weight loss strategies before it becomes more difficult 
                <br> to control their eating habits and activity levels.
              </p>
              <p class="text-left">
                Fortunately, there are ways to determine your body mass index so that you know what to do! 
                <br>
                This article will go into detail on  <a href="./bmi-calculator.html" class="t-n btn-outline-danger">how to calculate your BMI.</a>

              <h2 class="text-left">Calculate your BMI</h2>

              <p class="text-left"> The next step in determining if you have a healthy weight is calculating your body mass index (BMI).
                <br>
                 A body mass index greater than 25 is considered overweight, while less than 24 is considered normal.
                </p>

                <img class="img-mid w-75" src="./assets/img/bmi-mid.png" alt="img-mid">

                <p class="text-left mt-4">
                  A body mass index higher than 30 indicates obesity.
                  <br>
                   People with this degree of obesity are at risk for <b>serious health conditions like heart disease</b>  and <span class="color-ch">diabetes</a></span>.
                </p>

                <p class="text-left mt-4">
                  To calculate your BMI, use these numbers as guidelines:
                  <ul>
                    <li>24 or under = ideal body weight</li>
                    <li>25 to 29.9 = overweight</li>
                    <li>30 or above = obese</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <p class="text-left">It’s important to note that people with very thin or very fat bodies can be suffering from eating disorders or obesity.
                  <br> So it’s not just about how much money they cost you in clothes!</p>
                <p class="text-left">The best way to understand your own body size is to compare yourself to others your age and sex. <br> For example, if you weigh more than someone his/her same height, then you probably outweigh them, <br> so you would put into effect a healthier BMI.</p>
                <p class="text-left">Another good rule of thumb is to see what shape your body is currently in and whether those changes are positive or negative. <br> If you feel happier with your body, then you’re using it properly, but wishing you had thinner legs or flatter stomachs means <br> you might want to make some tweaks to <b>stay within optimal limits</b>.</p>
                
            </div>

            <div class="text-left sec-3 container">
              <h2 class="text-left">Find your BMI category</h2>

              <p class="text-left"> The next step in calculating your <b>body mass index</b>  is finding your place in one of the <i>eight major categories</i> . <br> These include: underweight, healthy weight, overweight, obese class I-II, obesity III-IV, or a pre-obese state.
                </p>
                <p class="text-left"> The first two are considered normal or healthy weights. <br> People who fall into this group have always been defined as having an appropriate amount of weight for their height.
                </p>

                <img class="img-last w-75" src="./assets/img/bmi-last.png" alt="img-mid">

                <p class="text-left mt-4">
                  If you find that you’re within these two categories, give yourself a pat on the back! You’ve got a great health status.
                </p>

                <p class="text-left mt-4">
                  However, if you identify as being in the other six groups, it’s important to note that not all heights are equal. <br> A person with a <b>tall stature may need</b>  to watch how much they eat to maintain their health.
                </p>

                <p class="text-left"> 
                  Also, people who are very active can burn more calories than someone who isn’t as active. <br> If you want to know where you fit into the BMI scale, talk to your doctor or dietician about what is meaningful to you and your lifestyle.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-left">Replace your diet with a healthy eating plan</h2>

                <p class="text-left">Having an adequate amount of nutrients in your body is important for overall health and weight loss. <br> To determine if you have enough, we need to look at how much nutrition you are ingesting as well as how much you’re consuming.</p>
                <p class="text-left">We can calculate your BMI by using both of these factors. <br> By having an appropriate number of calories, you will find that your <b>height needs adjustment</b>  because of bone density. <br> This way, you get a more accurate calculation of your total body mass!</p>
                <p class="text-left">Here’s what the calculations look like:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Calories divided by 2,000 equals nutritional intake</li>
                    <li>Nutritional intake multiplied by 7% equals consumption</li>
                    <li>Multiply the <b>two numbers together</b>  to see your final BMI score.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-left">Tone your muscles with an exercise plan</h2>
                <p class="text-left">Having a higher BMI does not necessarily mean that you are more likely to gain weight or suffer from obesity. <br> It can even be considered neutral, as too much muscle tissue helps keep our body lean and tall.</p>
                <p class="text-left">By having <b>enough muscle mass</b> , your blood circulation is improved which aids in keeping your heart healthy. <br> Also, studies show that <i>eating less may be</i>  easier when you’re overweight due to your body using its own hormones to regulate hunger.</p>
                <p class="text-left">However, it is important to note that most people who have a normal-weight range of BMIs also include some amount of fat within their bodies. <br> Just like someone who is very muscular could still have some level of adipose tissue (fat), people with a normal BMI may also have small amounts <br> of excess body fat.</p>
                <p class="text-left">Having an underweight body type is very possible if you do not have enough muscle in your body. <br> People with this body shape are called “athletes” because they feel that their lack of fat makes them spend more time exercising, <br> which contributes to weight loss.</p>
