          <h1 class="text-left"> What’s a Ketogenic Diet?</h1>

          <!-- 1 -->    
          <h2 class="text-left mt-5">What Is It?</h2>
          <p class="text-left">
            “Ketogenic” is a term for a low-carb diet (like the Atkins diet). <br> The idea is for you to get more calories from protein and fat and less from carbohydrates.<br> You cut back most on the carbs that are easy to digest, like sugar, soda, pastries, and white bread.
          </p>

          <!-- 2 -->   
          <h2 class="text-left mt-5">How It Works</h2>
          <p class="text-left">
            When you eat less than 50 grams of carbs a day, your body eventually runs out of fuel (blood sugar) it can use quickly.<br> This typically takes 3 to 4 days. <br> Then you’ll start to break down protein and fat for energy, which can make you lose weight. This is called ketosis.<br> It's important to note that the ketogenic diet is a short term diet that's focussed on weight loss rather than the pursuit of health benefits. 
          </p>
          <img class="text-left keto-images w-75" src="./assets/img/keto-2.jpg" alt="keto-picture">

          <!-- 3 --> 
          <h2 class="text-left mt-5">Who Uses It?</h2>
          <p class="text-left">
            People use a ketogenic diet most often to lose weight, but it can help manage certain medical conditions, like epilepsy, too.<br> It also may help people with heart disease, certain brain diseases, and even acne, but there needs to be more research in those areas.<br> Talk with your doctor first to find out if it’s safe for you to try a ketogenic diet, especially if you have type 1 diabetes.
          </p>

          <!-- 4 --> 
          <h2 class="text-left mt-5">Weight Loss</h2>
          <p class="text-left">
            A ketogenic diet may help you lose more weight in the first 3 to 6 months than some other diets.<br> This may be because it takes more calories to change fat into energy than it does to change carbs into energy. <br>It’s also possible that a high-fat, high-protein diet satisfies you more, so you eat less, but that hasn’t been proved yet.
          </p>

          <!-- 5 --> 
          <h2 class="text-left mt-5">Cancer</h2>
          <p class="text-left">
            Insulin is a hormone that lets your body use or store sugar as fuel. <br>Ketogenic diets make you burn through this fuel quickly, so you don’t need to store it.<br> This means your body needs -- and makes -- less insulin.<br> Those lower levels may help protect you against some kinds of cancer or even slow the growth of cancer cells.<br> More research is needed on this, though.
          </p>
          <img class="text-left keto-images w-75" src="./assets/img/keto-5.jpg" alt="keto-picture">

          <!-- 6 -->
          <h2 class="text-left mt-5">Heart Disease</h2>
          <p class="text-left">
            It seems strange that a diet that calls for more fat can raise “good” cholesterol and lower “bad” cholesterol,<br> but ketogenic diets are linked to just that. <br>It may be because the lower levels of insulin that result from these diets can stop your body from making more cholesterol.<br> That means you’re less likely to have high blood pressure, hardened arteries, heart failure, and other heart conditions.<br> It's unclear, however; how long these effects last.
          </p>
          <img class="text-left keto-images w-75" src="./assets/img/keto-6.jpg" alt="keto-picture">
          <br>

          <!-- 7 -->
          <h2 class="text-left mt-5">Acne</h2>
          <p class="text-left">
            Carbohydrates have been linked to this skin condition, so cutting down on them may help.<br> And the drop in insulin that a ketogenic diet can trigger may also help stop acne breakouts.<br> (Insulin can cause your body to make other hormones that bring on outbreaks.)<br> Still, more research is needed to determine exactly how much effect, if any, the diet actually has on acne. 
          </p>

          <!-- 8 -->
          <h2 class="text-left mt-5">Diabetes</h2>
          <p class="text-left">
            Low-carb diets seem to help keep your blood sugar lower and more predictable than other diets.<br> But when your body burns fat for energy, it makes compounds called ketones.<br> If you have diabetes, particularly type 1, too many ketones in your blood can make you sick.<br> So it’s very important to work with your doctor on any changes in your diet.
          </p>

        <!-- 9 -->
          <h2 class="text-left mt-5">Epilepsy</h2>
          <p class="text-left">
            Ketogenic diets have helped control seizures caused by this condition since the 1920s.<br> But again, it’s important to work with your doctor to figure out what’s right for you or your child. 
          </p>

             <!-- 10 -->
          <h2 class="text-left mt-5">Other Nervous System Disorders</h2>
          <p class="text-left">
            These affect your brain and spine, as well as the nerves that link them together.<br> Epilepsy is one, but others may be helped by a ketogenic diet as well,<br> including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and sleep disorders.<br> Scientists aren’t sure why, but it may be that the ketones your body makes<br> when it breaks down fat for energy help protect your brain cells from damage.
          </p>

          <!-- 11 -->
          <h2 class="text-left mt-5">Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</h2>
          <p class="text-left">
            This is when a woman’s ovaries get larger than they should be and small fluid-filled sacs form around the eggs.<br> High levels of insulin can cause it.<br> Ketogenic diets, which lower both the amount of insulin you make and the amount you need,<br> may help treat it, along with other lifestyle changes, like exercise and weight loss.
          </p>
          <img class="text-left keto-images w-75" src="./assets/img/keto-11.jpg" alt="keto-picture">

             <!-- 12 -->
          <h2 class="text-left mt-5">Exercise</h2>
          <p class="text-left">
            A ketogenic diet may help endurance athletes -- runners and cyclists, for example -- when they train.<br> Over time, it helps your muscle-to-fat ratio and raises the amount of oxygen your body is able to use when it’s working hard.<br> But while it might help in training, it may not work as well as other diets for peak performance.
          </p>
          <img class="text-left keto-images w-75" src="./assets/img/keto-12.jpg" alt="keto-picture">
          <br>

          <!-- 13 -->
          <h2 class="text-left mt-5">Side Effects</h2>
          <p class="text-left">
            The more common ones aren’t usually serious: You might have constipation, mild low blood sugar, or indigestion.<br> Much less often, low-carb diets can lead to kidney stones or high levels of acid in your body (acidosis). <br>Other side effects can include the "keto flu," which may include headache, weakness, and irritability; bad breath; and fatigue.
          </p>
          <img class="text-left keto-images w-75" src="./assets/img/keto-13.jpg" alt="keto-picture">
          <br>

        <!-- 14 -->
          <h2 class="text-left mt-5">Diet With Care</h2>
          <p class="text-left">
            When your body burns its stores of fat, it can be hard on your kidneys.<br> And starting a ketogenic diet -- or going back to a normal diet afterward <br>-- can be tricky if you’re obese because of other health issues you’re likely to have,<br> like diabetes, a heart condition, or high blood pressure. <br>If you have any of these conditions, make diet changes slowly and only with the guidance of your doctor.
